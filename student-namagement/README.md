# Student-Management-System

### In this project, I write a good example of building CRUD Operation and RESTful APIs web services with Spring Boot, JPA, and Hibernate, PostgreSQL.

### Features of Student Management System

* Insert Basic details of a Student(Student ID, Name, Surname, Admission date, Address)
* Update any of the details of a Student
* Delete a Student Record
* Display the list of Students in the Database

*To get student data, you just need to send a request, as shown in the image*
